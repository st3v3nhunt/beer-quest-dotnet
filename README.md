## Running the application

If you just want to start the application execute `dotnet run` in the project
directory.

If you want to hot reload the application as it is being changed (very useful
for development) execute `dotnet watch` in the project directory.

## API Documentation

Swagger has been included to document the API. When the application is first
run, this is the default page that will open. From the swagger the APIs can be
explored.
